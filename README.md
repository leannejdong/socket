# C-based Socket Client/Server (Learn)

## What is a socket?

In layman’s term, a Socket is an end point of communication between two systems on a network. To be a bit precise, a socket is a combination of IP address and port on one system. So on each system a socket exists for a process interacting with the socket on other system over the network. A combination of local socket and the socket at the remote system is also known a ‘Four tuple’ or ‘4-tuple’. Each connection between two processes running at different systems can be uniquely identified through their 4-tuple.

## Steps

1. Connecting the Client

2. Getting the hostname

3. Getting the Port Number

4. Connecting to the Server
